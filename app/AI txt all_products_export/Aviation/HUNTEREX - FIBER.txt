HUNTEREX-FIBER is an advanced technology kamikaze mini unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with a fiber-optic cable-supported communication infrastructure.

 Thanks to its advanced communication system, HUNTEREX-FIBER is resistant to jamming systems and ensures highly reliable communication. It is specifically designed to meet the need for secure data transmission under electronic warfare conditions. With its high-strength fiber optic cable and advanced spool system, HUNTEREX-FIBER maintains continuous two-way communication with the control unit during flight.
 This bidirectional communication enables the operator to manage the UAV’s payload in real-time and to redirect the vehicle as needed throughout the mission. 

What makes this UAV strategically significant is its ability to continue flight even if the spool system is severed, thanks to its resilient communication infrastructure.
