The HD30 is a flagship underlift system developed by a Hungarian manufacturer with over 30 years of experience in designing and building heavy-duty recovery equipment. Known for its in-house development and fabrication processes, our company has earned a strong reputation in the defence and logistics sectors for delivering robust, mission-ready systems that excel under pressure.

The HD30 is specifically designed for high-performance recovery operations, where strength, reach and stability are essential. It features a bottom-mounted pivot and a reinforced underlift with dual hydraulic extension, reaching an outstanding 4,810 mm.
This extended range offers critical flexibility in tactical and logistical missions, making it suitable for a wide variety of vehicle platforms and operational scenarios.

Engineered with maximum lifting performance in mind, the HD30 provides 10,000 kg capacity on forks and L-arms when fully extended. When retracted, it delivers an exceptional 30,000 kg lifting force on forks while maintaining 10,000 kg on L-arms. These capabilities set a new benchmark for strength and reliability in its class, outperforming many comparable systems on the international market.

The HD30 is available both as a complete recovery truck and as a CKD/export kit. Every unit is built to integrate easily with different chassis configurations, offering adaptability for domestic use or export.

 Our commitment to quality and operational readiness is reflected in every component — from precision machining to battlefield durability — ensuring dependable performance in even the harshest conditions.
