Mobile Phone Remote Access

The GTB solution is remote access to your Android phone left at home. Why should you leave your phone at home? You as the mobile phone user cannot be
identified based on your radio footprint (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, IMSI). Your phone cannot be stolen, lost or investigated. Your phone cannot be hacked physically,
through the radio interface, or by malicious software. Why should you always have your phone with you?
-You cannot access and read your incoming SMS and instant messages.
-You cannot make and receive calls. You don't have access to the files, images, contacts and apps on your phone.
-Using a new phone number is backward when making and receiving calls.

Periodic and comprehensive protection of your phone:
-when your personal presence somewhere is vital, but the environment around you is hostile.
-when the data – files, images etc. – stored on your phone may be at risk, but data or apps on your phone are needed.
-End-to-end encryption.
-On-premises server for communication setup.
