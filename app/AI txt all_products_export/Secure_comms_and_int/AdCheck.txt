Everyone has a digital footprint, based on their activity on the Internet. AdCheck collects information on a person by mapping part of this footprint focusing on ads placed by the individual.

However, AdCheck goes beyond regular OSINT as it can be used to build a trusted relationship with the target. Generally, the individuals placing the ads trust the neutrality of the individual contacting them.

By referring to the ad, it is possible to meet the person, establish a personal linkage, and get to know their living conditions, social environment and dwelling place. In addition, there is a special opportunity when the target sells electronics (laptop, phone) or places ads for the purpose of buying rather than selling.

AdCheck provides active help to reveal the target person's close environment and bring in specific expertise during follow up visits.

Key Features:
- Looking at the ads placed by the target or by closely related family and friends we will uncover a lot of information without raising suspicion. AdCheck helps us learn about assets, interests (e.g.: hunting, sailing, sport cars), or even favourite locations (e.g.: vacation house) and storage spaces (e.g.: garage, rented depository).
