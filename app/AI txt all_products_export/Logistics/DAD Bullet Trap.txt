Termék: DAD Bullet Trap

The DAD bullet trap is a portable device that requires minimal space and is designed to safely check whether handguns or rifles are loaded, in full compliance with weapon handling regulations. 

The DAD unit operates like a swirling drum, effectively absorbing harmful, unwanted, and environmentally hazardous elements produced by firearm discharges. It protects both the user and their surroundings from the harmful effects of a shot, with the exception of minimal gunpowder residue.

 This bullet trap functions as a mobile safety device suitable for use by specialized units and personnel, while adhering to all weapon usage protocols. 

It can be utilized in various settings such as the armed forces, law enforcement agencies, security services, shooting ranges (including sub-sections), financial institutions, official laboratories, and more — to neutralize the risks associated with firearm testing and clearance. The DAD bullet trap is capable of safely handling firearms with muzzle energy up to 5000 Joules.
