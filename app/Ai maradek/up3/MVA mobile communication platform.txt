Termék: MVA mobile communication platform

Communication via mobile devices, i.e. mobile conversations and instant messages, have become widespread all around the world. 

A variety of free and paid communications solutions have emerged even providing end-end encrypted secure communications. However, in terms of security, there is still room for
improvement. With the introduction of the MVA mobile communication solution, we want to take communication security to the next level. MVA makes sure that
no unauthorized person becomes aware of the content or even the fact of the communication. 

MVA enables the customer to control the communication app on
the user's device, restrict access to the app to a closed user group and control the central on-prem server managing the entire communication.

Key Features:
-In our MVA software platform, we use today's most advanced and secure technologies in a closed ecosystem:
-Fully encrypted communication.
-No identification possible based on phone number and e-mail address.
-Self-hosted server.
-Closed user group.
-Application built on an open source solution.
