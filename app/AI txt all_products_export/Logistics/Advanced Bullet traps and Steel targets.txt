Termék: Advanced Bullet traps and Steel targets

We offer high-performance bullet trap systems and steel targets made exclusively from HARDOX 600, a premium-grade steel known for superior durability and impact resistance. Designed for high-volume use and calibers up to 20,000 Joules, our products are engineered for demanding live-fire environments.
-Lamellated Bullet Trap
Constructed from non-welded HARDOX 600, this modular trap safely absorbs and redirects bullets. It features a fireproof, self-healing anti-ricochet surface, rated for up to 80,000 shots/m². No sand or rubber needed. Includes a sealed lead collection system for safe operation and minimal maintenance.
-Funnel Bullet Trap – "Big Vortex"
Optimized for continuous fire, this spiral deceleration system captures rounds without ricochet or dust. Fully HARDOX 600 construction ensures long service life. Integrated closed lead capture keeps operation clean and safe, with minimal upkeep.
-HUN-Target Steel Target Systems
Our steel targets are built to withstand repeated hits from handguns, rifles, and shotguns—up to 15,000 J. All designs prioritize safety, deflection, and quick deployment. Target types include:
-IPSC/IDPA silhouettes and hostage targets
Reactive swinging, falling plates
Dueling trees, plate racks, CQB setups
Pop-up and custom shapes on request
-All targets are modular, field-ready, and resistant to warping or deformation under intense training conditions.
Whether for fixed ranges, mobile deployments, or tactical facilities, our bullet traps and target systems offer unmatched performance, safety, and longevity for modern combat training environments.
