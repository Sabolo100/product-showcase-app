Termék: 16U Platform

Small satellite platform, the platform gains flight heritage with launch of MAUVE in 2025.

•	In-house developed structure and subsystems based on ECSS standards
•	5-year design lifetime in LEO
•	Double redundancy and soft degradation in all subsystems 
•	Single-point failure tolerant design 
•	Soft degradation in all subsystems & single-point failure tolerant design, that increases lifetime and reliability
•	Turn-key solution that covers the whole mission (from planning until deorbiting)
•	Structure optimized for high thermal dissipation density and thermo-elastic performance, both for the payload and the platform.
