ReDeDex is an AI-driven compliance system, which helps companies achieve and retain compliance with regulations and policies. The system automatically reviews and indexes policies, serving as a virtual Compliance Expert to provide an on-demand and instant overview current regulatory requirements they need to achieve.

The fully automated process handles adding, modifying and updating policies to match the highest current standards and eliminate the possibility of oversights or human error when reviewing requirements.

-Training the system is automatic, including the processing and distribution of custom company policies across branches.
-Using the system doesn’t require additional training, as the intuitive interface and chat- or speech-based operating process enables any non-technical personnel to access its vast knowledge in an instant. ReDeDex is a multi-layer AI system, with a highly reliable expert-system handling database rules, to determine the core of the answers, while a generative AI handles speech processing and answer generation.
-The combined use of these two layers ensures a faster processing of even complex questions that would prove hard to find in traditional knowledgebases or databases, while the answers given are restricted to a strict set of rules and policies to prevent misinformation.
-Answers are generated both in speech and with directions to the specific topics in the respective policy or booklet, giving a quick summary when needed or providing exact sources for thorough reviews. ReDeDex also helps define and understand the policies and helps users determine if a specific regulation or policy applies to certain scenarios.
