The Kenno – CN20 project is an innovative, modular defense solution that combines rapid deployability, high mobility, and robust ballistic protection. This combined system integrates the foldable CN20 container platform with the armored BALPRO Protector 3M modules developed by Kenno Tech, delivering a mobile protection unit designed to perform reliably even in the most demanding operational environments.

-Compliant with the STANAG 2280 ballistic protection standard, the system provides A3/C4 level protection when empty and up to A4/C5 level when filled with sand or gravel—offering effective defense against small/medium caliber projectiles, shoulder-launched weapons, rifle grenades, battlefield rockets (122 mm), artillery (155mm), mortars, and small/personnel-borne IEDs.
-While the CN20 container itself can be deployed within 3–5 minutes, the protective armor modules can be installed around the unit in just 2–4 hours.
-An optional blast-resistant shield module can be added and positioned on elevated ground next to the container to provide enhanced protection for critical operations, whether during field training or active deployment.
Ideal applications include:
-Forward command and control posts
-Temporary guard stations and base units
-Mobile protected operations centers
-Blast- and bullet-resistant logistics hubs
-The goal of the Kenno collaboration is to deliver an adaptive, high-security protective infrastructure that enables rapid response in both military missions—bringing flexibility and resilience wherever it's needed most.
