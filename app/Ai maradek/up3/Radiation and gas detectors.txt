Termék: Radiation and gas detectors

The company offers highly sensitive instruments and systems designed for measuring gamma radiation level in a wide range. These devices are suitable
for the aerial and terrestrial reconnaissance of widely contaminated areas after nuclear incidents, and for the localization and identification of gamma and
neutron orphan sources. GTI gas detectors are intelligent transmitters with quick and reliable operation, low-noise electronics, excellent zero and span
stability.

Key Features:
-Radiation measurement with GeigerMüller counters and spectrometric scintillation detectors.
-Wide range of gas sensors (electrochemical, pellistor, PID, NDIR).
-Ideal tools for radiation protection applications and environment monitoring.
-Suitable instruments for UAV, UGV applications.
-Various configurations for different vehicles with radiation level meters and spectrometric probes.
