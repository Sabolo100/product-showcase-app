Termék: HC02.UAV – HC02.SIM

HC02.UAV
Based on the HC02 the HC02.UAV eliminates human risk and extends flight endurance in mission-critical tasks like:
-Surveillance
-Attack
-Behind the border logistics and rescue.
-Due to in-house design and production including mechanical, electrical and software, every customer-specific modification and customisation is possible if needed. 
-Multiple communication channels are available, like LOS (Low Orbit Satellite), encrypted, mesh-capable direct RF link with a backup 4G/LTE connection.

HC02.SIM – Remote controller
-One of the most crucial parts of UAV operation is training. 
-The HC02.SIM is based on a realistic physical engine with almost indistinguishable real-life detailed VR graphics, moreover a 6 dimension of freedom motion platform to feel every movement like an onboard pilot. 
-Besides the training functionality the HC02.SIM is the remote controller of HC02.UAV. Thus, the well-known training environment bestows confidence.
