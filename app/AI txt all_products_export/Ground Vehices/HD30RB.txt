The HD30RB is a multi-role recovery platform designed for military and tactical use, combining the proven underlift system of the HD30 with an integrated, high-capacity two-stage recovery boom. Developed by our company — a Hungarian manufacturer with more than 30 years of experience in military-grade towing and recovery systems — the HD30RB represents the next step in operational versatility and lifting power.

Built for scenarios where both towing and winching are required, the HD30RB offers exceptional flexibility in battlefield or high-demand logistics environments. The dual-stage boom extends up to 5,000 mm with a maximum lifting capacity of 14,000 kg when extended and 30,000 kg when retracted. With a maximum boom angle of 44°, this system enables complex recoveries in environments where vertical reach and controlled movement are critical.

At its core, the HD30RB retains the trusted HD30 underlift architecture — a hydraulically extendable, bottom-pivot design capable of 4,810 mm reach and reinforced for exceptional strength and stability.

Fully extended, the underlift handles 10,000 kg on both forks and L-arms, and up to 30,000 kg on forks when retracted. These combined systems provide unmatched capability for armed forces and specialized fleets requiring maximum flexibility in field recovery.

The HD30RB is available as a fully assembled system or as a CKD/export kit for local integration. As with all solutions, each component is designed, manufactured, and assembled in-house for total quality control and mission-ready durability.
