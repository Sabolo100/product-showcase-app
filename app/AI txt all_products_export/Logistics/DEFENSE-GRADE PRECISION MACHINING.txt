Ferro-Tool Ltd. supports projects with high-precision machining and complete manufacturing support, from prototype through small/medium series.

Example applications where Ferro-Tool can support you (upon request):
-Sensor & optical mounting brackets (lightweight designs, high stiffness, precision locating faces)
-Electronics housings/shielded enclosures (sealing faces, O-ring grooves, shielding preparation)
-Fastening & locating components (pins, bushings, spacers, adapters)
-Drive/gearbox components (housings, covers, bearing seats, precision fits)
-Hydraulic/pneumatic manifolds (hole patterns, threads, ports, sealing surfaces)
-High-precision base plates/fixtures (dowel locating, reference planes, repeatable positioning)
-Ground guide rails/sliding surfaces (surface & cylindrical grinding)
-High-precision spacers/gauge & setting parts
-Manufacturing & inspection fixtures (prototype + small series)
-Custom assembly fixtures (repeatable assembly, short changeover time)

Key Features:
- Production scope: prototype → small/medium series ramp-up
- One-stop manufacturing: design support + machining + assembly + testing under one roof
- High precision capability: process chain designed for tight tolerances and precision fits
- Complex geometry ready: 5-axis + EDM combination for demanding geometries
