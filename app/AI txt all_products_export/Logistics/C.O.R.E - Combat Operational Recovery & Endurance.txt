Termék: C.O.R.E - Combat Operational Recovery & Endurance

CORE, developed and built on decades of clinical and biotechnological expertise, is a scientifically validated preventive system engineered for extreme conditions faced in defense operations and space missions. At its heart lies a proprietary phospholipid nano-delivery platform, ensuring 70-100 times higher absorption of active ingredients, delivering them precisely when and where the body needs them, whether in desert heat, arctic cold, or microgravity.
Designed for maximum reliability, CORE comes in ergonomic, pre-dosed liquid formats that are logistically optimized, easy to use, and remain stable for up to three years. This makes CORE an essential preventive asset for deployed forces, special operations, long-range expeditions, and extended spaceflights, where supply chains are limited and mission-readiness is critical.
The Mission Pack system - Prep (preparation), Field (deployment), Recovery (regeneration) provides targeted support across every operational phase:
Boosts endurance by maximizing muscular and neurological performance under sustained load.
Sharpens focus through scientifically selected nootropics and antioxidants for cognitive stability.
Accelerates recovery with cellular-level repair and inflammation control.
Strengthens immunity, reducing downtime caused by illness or fatigue during prolonged missions.
CORE is not merely a nutritional supplement. It is a strategic prevention tool, optimizing the body’s performance center to make soldiers and astronauts stronger, more resilient, and faster to recover in the most demanding environments.
The CORE Space Edition, developed specifically for aerospace applications, supports bone and muscle protection, cognitive clarity, and regenerative capacity in microgravity. It ensures that mission crews maintain their full physical and mental capabilities over extended periods, a decisive factor for the sustainable human presence in space.
CORE - Setting a new standard in military and space-grade human performance.

Key Features:
- Product Categories: Liposomal and nano-formulated micronutrient complexes; standardized phytochemical-based nano-bioactive concentrates; peptide-based, liposomal collagen nanomatrices; nano-liposomal fungal bioactives
- Delivery Format: Pre-dosed liquid ampoules / sachets
