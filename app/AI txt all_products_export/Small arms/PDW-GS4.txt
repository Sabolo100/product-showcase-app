The PDW-GS4 is a thigh holster and full-automatic shooting adapter in one. 
-It is made for members of law enforcement and military organizations who only have a semi-automatic pistol as their regular weapon (like police patrol).
-If required, by pressing a release button the users can tilt the pistol to the side, take it out of the holster to fire single shots.
-If more firepower is needed, the users can remove, with a quick release, the whole thigh holster containing the pistol. 
-Holding the rear handle sets the adapter into ready-for-fire position and the pistol is loaded by pulling the loading grip.
-The users may want to pull out the shoulder rest and the adapter, so they can target and fire the weapon in a fully automatic way from the shoulder.
