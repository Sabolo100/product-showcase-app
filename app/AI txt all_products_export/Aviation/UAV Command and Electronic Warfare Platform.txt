-Command and Autonomous Fleet Management
Our distributed platform delivers a secure, modular command interface for coordinating multiple autonomous UAVs in a unified C4ISR environment. It can run as a stand-alone suite or integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure, with each module also available individually. Predictive threat modeling and automated countermeasure deployment let every UAV adapt instantly to changing conditions, ensuring resilient command and fleet management across distributed operations.
-Adaptive Frequency Hopping for Anti-Jamming Protection
To mitigate the risk of signal jamming and interception, the system features adaptive frequency hopping. Automatic hopping is enabled by default, but operators can also manually adjust communication frequencies to suit specific threat environments.
-Threat Detection and Prediction with Sensor Fusion
Based on integrated data from multiple external sensors, AI-driven pattern recognition algorithms identify and predict threats. This enables real-time alerts and precise, targeted countermeasures—enhancing responsiveness in complex electromagnetic environments.
By combining autonomous UAV control, electronic warfare capabilities, and intelligent threat response, our platform offers a comprehensive solution for securing unmanned operations in contested environments.
