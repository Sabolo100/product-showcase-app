This modular shooting range is an ideal solution for military, law enforcement, and security forces needing to conduct flexible, high-performance basic training in diverse environments.
-It supports a range of small arms (0.22mm, 9mm, 5.56mm, and 7.62 NATO calibers) shooting exercises, with ballistic protection and noise insulation ensuring safety and minimizing disruption. 

-The range's enclosed design, which reduces noise to 50-70 decibels, makes it suitable for use in densely populated urban areas or remote locations near environmentally protected zones, where traditional open-air ranges would be unable to operate

-The range's modular design features four shooting positions and a 15m shooting distance, which can be reconfigured to accommodate up to five shooting positions and extended distances.

-It can be fully operational within 12 hours and is easily transportable using flatbed trucks or container trailers, making it ideal for rapid deployment in restricted or sensitive areas.
