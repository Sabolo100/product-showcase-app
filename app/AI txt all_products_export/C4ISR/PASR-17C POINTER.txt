PASR-17c ‘Pointer’ is a short-to-middlerange Passive Coherent Locator (also known as passive radar) for air surveillance applications.

As a passive radar, while detecting the moving targets, the radar utilises the existing radio frequency sources in the environment, instead of actively illuminating the surveillance area. The utilised illuminators, or so-called Illuminators of Opportunity (IoO) are typically broadcasting signals.
-Since the radar has no RF emission itis able to operate fully covert without the need of frequency authorization.
-Fully covert operation, low system and maintenance cost.
-Easy integration with Command-and-Control Systems.
