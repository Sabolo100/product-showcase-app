Termék: Modular Shooting Range Systems

Our Modular Shooting Range Systems are high-performance, relocatable infrastructures designed for live-fire training, tactical simulation, and operational support. Built from internally reinforced steel modules, each unit meets strict ballistic and environmental safety standards.
-Custom Dimensions & Layouts
Modules are 2 meters deep, with widths of 6, 8, 10, or 12 meters, and a standard 3-meter internal height. Ranges can be configured in 2-meter increments up to 300+ meters and beyond. Designed for rapid deployment, reconfiguration, or permanent installation.
-Certified for High-Energy Weapons
-Live-fire rated up to 20,000 Joules, compatible with NATO-standard and high-caliber weapons. Supports various target systems including static, steel, pop-up, and programmable moving targets. Internal ballistic protection minimizes ricochets, ensuring user safety during intense drills.
-Advanced Air Safety
-A multi-stage ventilation and filtration system ensures up to 25,000 m³/h of airflow, filtering lead particles and combustion gases. This maintains air quality within occupational safety standards, even during sustained use.
-Low-Maintenance Design
-Corrosion-resistant surfaces, easy-access components, and modular construction allow fast upkeep with minimal tools and personnel.
-Expandable Training Environments
-Modules can be tailored for CQB zones, multi-level urban combat structures, or specialized spaces such as:
-Briefing rooms and classrooms
-Armories and weapon storage
-Simulation or dry-fire zones
-Command, control, or security rooms
-Locker rooms or rest areas
-Fully Tailored Solutions
-Delivered ready for assembly and customized to your mission profile. Our team supports planning, logistics, and commissioning to ensure seamless integration.

Whether for military, law enforcement, or defense industry use, this modular system delivers unmatched flexibility and safety—anywhere, anytime.
