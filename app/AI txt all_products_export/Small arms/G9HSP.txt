The main feature of the G9HSP pistol is the modular and interchangeable firing mechanism: it can be either hammer-fired or striker-fired. Due to the modular design of the weapon, the transition from one type of firing mechanism to another takes approximately thirty seconds. Three component groups need to be replaced during this transition: the firing pin housing, the recoil spring, and the firing block. The latter, containing the firing mechanism is mounted in a removable module and can be easily lifted out with a single motion.
The pistol utilizes Glock’s plastic magazines, to ensure compatibility with the Glock handguns used by the Hungarian Defence Forces.
Its system features a short recoil, barrel-block locking mechanism.
The firing mechanism allows for double-action firing, enabling consecutive shots without manual cocking.
It has a decocker and triplex safety system.
The controls are ambidextrous, designed to facilitate both right- and left-handed use.
The rear, interchangeable panel of the handgrip is available in three sizes (S, M, L) for customization.
The handgun underwent a comprehensive NATO military testing and trials were ran on the handgun by the Firearms Experimental Examination Division of the Hungarian Defence Forces’ Force Modernization and Transformation Command. Experts conducted a 10.000-round test, including so called „torture test”.
The pistol successfully completed troop trials and operational field testing within the Hungarian Defence Forces. Additional versions of the pistol firing .40 Smith and Wesson and .45 ACP ammunition are currently under development. The magazine capacities for these versions are 15 rounds for the .40 S&W calibre and 13 rounds for the .45 calibre.
